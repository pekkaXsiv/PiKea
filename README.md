# PiKea
Building a PiKea gaming table as christmas present to my godson.

I have followed Spannerspacer's instructions from Element14 throught this project, using his scetch codes and equipement.
Link to his instructions are at link below and I wont post any scetch code etc. here, because I want people to visit to his instructions and give him credit :)
In this project I will post pictures about the project and give some advices to problems I faces during the project.
